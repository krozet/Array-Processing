# The Problem

Array processing (elimination of three largest values) (one of many array reduction problems) The array a(1..n) contains arbitrary integers. Write a function reduce(a,n) that reduces the array a(1..n) by eliminating from it all values that are equal to three largest different integers. For example, if a=(9,1,1,6,7,1,2,3,3,5,6,6,6,6,7,9) then three largest different integers are 6,7,9 and after reduction the reduced array will be a=(1,1,1,2,3,3,5), n=7. The solution should have time complexity O(n).



# Implementation

My method for reducing the array involves moving through the array and finding the three largest values. Then, I remove those values from the array and push all the values to the left. After this is done, I take the final size the array should be and copy its contents into a new array of this final size and print its contents to the screen. This algorithm is within O(n) complexity.

The portion of my method that takes the longest is where I have to remove each value from the array and shift the remaining elements over by one value to the left. This process can&#39;t be helped while working with integer arrays, and I believe switching to using vectors instead would help improve performance here.

Since the problem asked for a simple and quick solution, I decided to go with the method down below. If I were ask to improve the algorithm&#39;s performance, I would have gone with my original plan invloving a pointer at each end of the array, both finding the three highest values, and once they pass each other begin removing those values from the array. I believe this would increase performance by a fair amount but not enough to sacrifice the simplicity the problem asked for.

# Example Build and Execution through Terminal

&gt; g++ -o ap arr-process.cpp

&gt; ./ap

Before reduction: 9 1 1 6 7 1 2 3 3 5 6 6 6 6 7 9

After reduction: 1 1 1 2 3 3 5
